# Password-Strength-Predictor-Using-ML

## Overview
This project aims to predict the strength of passwords using machine learning techniques. By leveraging natural language processing (TF-IDF vectorization) and classification models like logistic regression, we assess and classify passwords as weak, good, or strong. The system provides real-time feedback to users, helping them create stronger and more secure passwords.

## Features
- Uses **TF-IDF vectorization** for feature extraction from password data.
- Implements **Logistic Regression** for classification.
- Provides **real-time password strength prediction**.
- Compares various machine learning models (XGBoost, Na√Øve Bayes, SVM, etc.).
- Supports integration with authentication systems to enhance security.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (sklearn)
- Seaborn, Matplotlib (for visualization)

## Usage
1. Enter a password in the input prompt.
2. The system will evaluate and classify the password strength.
3. Get feedback on improving weak passwords.

## Results and Accuracy
- XGBoost achieves the highest accuracy for password classification.
- Logistic Regression offers a balance between accuracy and training efficiency.
- The model is tested with over **600,000 password entries**.

## Future Scope
- Enhance real-time password policy recommendations.
- Integrate deep learning techniques for better predictions.
- Deploy as an API for wider usability.
